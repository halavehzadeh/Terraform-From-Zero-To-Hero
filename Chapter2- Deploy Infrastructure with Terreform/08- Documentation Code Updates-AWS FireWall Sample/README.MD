# Understanding the Challenge

Occasionally in the newer version of Providers, you will see some changes in
the way you create a resource.

Just because a better approach is recommended, does NOT always mean that
the older approach will stop working.
Organizations can continue to use the approach that suits best in itâ€™s
environment. 

## Switching to Older Provider Doc

You can always switch to the older version of provider documentation page to
understand the changes.

For larger enterprises, it becomes difficult to upgrade their code base to the
newer approach that provider recommends.
In such case, they stick with the appropriate provider version that supports the
older approach of creating the resource.
