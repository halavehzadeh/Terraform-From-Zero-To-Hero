## Understanding the Challenge

Letâ€™s assume there are 10 teams in your organization using Terraform to create
and manage EC2 instances.

## Challenge with the Previous Example

- Repetition of Code.
- Change in AWS Provider specific option will require change in EC2 code
  blocks of all the teams.
- Lack of standardization.
- Difficult to manage.
- Difficult for developers to use.

## Better Approach

In this approach, the DevOps Team has defined standard EC2 template in a
central location that all can use.
